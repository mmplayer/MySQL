mysql_install_db \- initialize MySQL data directory
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmysql_install_db\ [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR\ 'u
\fBmysql_install_db [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the system tables that it contains, if they do not exist\&. It also initializes the
system tablespace
and related data structures needed to manage
InnoDB
tables\&. As of MySQL 5\&.6\&.8,
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
is a Perl script and can be used on any system with Perl installed\&. Before 5\&.6\&.8, it is a shell script and is available only on Unix platforms\&.
.PP
As of MySQL 5\&.6\&.8, on Unix platforms,
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
creates a default option file named
my\&.cnf
in the base installation directory\&. This file is created from a template included in the distribution package named
my\-default\&.cnf\&. You can find the template in or under the base installation directory\&. When started using
\fBmysqld_safe\fR, the server uses
my\&.cnf
file by default\&. If
my\&.cnf
already exists,
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
assumes it to be in use and writes a new file named
my\-new\&.cnf
instead\&.
.PP
With one exception, the settings in the default option file are commented and have no effect\&. The exception is that the file changes the
sql_mode
system variable from its default of
NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
to also include
STRICT_TRANS_TABLES\&. This setting produces a server configuration that results in errors rather than warnings for bad data in operations that modify transactional tables\&. See
Section\ \&5.1.7, \(lqServer SQL Modes\(rq\&.
.PP
To invoke
\fBmysql_install_db\fR, use the following syntax:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_install_db [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Because the MySQL server,
\fBmysqld\fR, needs to access the data directory when it runs later, you should either run
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
from the same system account that will be used for running
\fBmysqld\fR
or run it as
root
and use the
\fB\-\-user\fR
option to indicate the user name that
\fBmysqld\fR
will run as\&. It might be necessary to specify other options such as
\fB\-\-basedir\fR
or
\fB\-\-datadir\fR
if
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
does not use the correct locations for the installation directory or data directory\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBscripts/mysql_install_db \-\-user=mysql \e\fR
         \fB\-\-basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \e\fR
         \fB\-\-datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
needs to invoke
\fBmysqld\fR
with the
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
and
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR
options\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
If you have set a custom
TMPDIR
environment variable when performing the installation, and the specified directory is not accessible,
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
may fail\&. If so, unset
TMPDIR
or set
TMPDIR
to point to the system temporary directory (usually
/tmp)\&.
.PP
After
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
sets up the
InnoDB
system tablespace, changes to some of tablespace characteristics require setting up a whole new
instance\&. This includes the file name of the first file in the system tablespace and the number of undo logs\&. If you do not want to use the default values, make sure that the settings for the
innodb_data_file_path
and
innodb_log_file_size
configuration options are in place in the MySQL
configuration file
before running
\fBmysql_install_db\fR\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the
[mysql_install_db]
group of an option file\&. (Options that are common to
\fBmysqld\fR
can also be specified in the
[mysqld]
group\&.) Other options are passed to
\fBmysqld\fR\&. For information about option files, see
Section\ \&4.2.3.3, \(lqUsing Option Files\(rq\&.
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
also supports the options for processing option files described at
Section\ \&4.2.3.4, \(lqCommand-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling\(rq\&.

.sp
On Unix platforms, this option provides for more secure MySQL installation\&. Invoking
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
with
\fB\-\-random\-passwords\fR
causes it to perform the following actions in addition to its normal operation:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Create a random password, assign it to the initial MySQL
root
accounts, and set the
\(lqpassword expired\(rq
flag for those accounts\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Write the initial password file to the
\&.mysql_secret
file in the directory named by the
HOME
environment variable\&. Depending on operating system, using a command such as
\fBsudo\fR
may cause the value of
HOME
to refer to the home directory of the
root
system user\&.
.sp
If
\&.mysql_secret
already exists, the new password information is appended to it\&. Each password entry includes a timestamp so that in the event of multiple install operations it is possible to determine the password associated with each one\&.
.sp
\&.mysql_secret
is created with mode 600 to be accessible only to the system user for whom it is created\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Remove the anonymous\-user MySQL accounts\&.
.RE
.sp
As a result of these actions, it is necessary after installation to start the server, connect as
root
using the password written to the
\&.mysql_secret
file, and to assign a new
root
password\&. Until this is done,
root
cannot do anything else\&. This must be done for each
root
account you intend to use\&. To change the password, you can use the
SET PASSWORD
statement (for example, with the
\fBmysql\fR
client)\&. You can also use
\fBmysqladmin\fR
or
\fBmysql_secure_installation\fR\&.
.sp
New RPM install operations (not upgrades) invoke
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
with the
\fB\-\-random\-passwords\fR
option\&. (Install operations using RPMs for Unbreakable Linux Network are unaffected because they do not use
\fBmysql_install_db\fR\&.)
.sp
As of MySQL 5\&.6\&.9, new Solaris PKG install operations (not upgrades) invoke
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
with the
\fB\-\-random\-passwords\fR
option\&.
.sp
For install operations using a binary
\&.tar\&.gz
distribution or a source distribution, you can invoke
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
with the
\fB\-\-random\-passwords\fR
option manually to make your MySQL installation more secure\&. This is recommended, particularly for sites with sensitive data\&.
